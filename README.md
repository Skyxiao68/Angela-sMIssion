The zip folder contains all the final and source files of our assets for our game. Each folder contains the environment assets, the clues and interactive assets, character assets and their animations. User Interface elements such as buttons and scene menus are also present in this file. The main tools we used to make our assets in pixel form is Aseprite and Pixel Studio. Aseprite was used to make the environmental assets for each floor as well as a few clue assets. Pixel Studio was used to make the character designs and a few assets. Krita was used to sketch out the assets and characters. The animations were created in Aseprite as well. The audio for our game which is the sound effects and background sound is exported from Pixabay. 

These assets reflect the work we have put in to make our game aesthetically pleasing and engaging. These assets are the final iterations of what will be displayed in our polished level.
